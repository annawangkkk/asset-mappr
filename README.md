## About this app
This is a web application developed by Carnegie Mellon University students, for use in community asset mapping. Asset mapping is a systematic process of cataloging key services, benefits, and resources within the community, such as individualsâ€™ skill sets, organizational resources, physical space, institutions, associations, and elements of the local economy. Communities need asset mapping in order to plan smartly for their future sustainability and growth.
